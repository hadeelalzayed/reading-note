You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sizedimages on several pages of your site. 
Images can be aligned both horizontally and verticallyusing CSS. You can use a background image behind the boxcreated by any element on a page.
Background images can appear just once or berepeated across the background of the box. 
You can create image rollover effects by moving thebackground position of an image. 
To reduce the number of images your browser has toload, you can create image sprites.
